● Prop Drilling:
   Prop drilling refers to the process of passing down data (props) from a parent component through
   one or more intermediary components to a child component, even if those intermediary
   components don't directly use the data themselves.
   It can make the code harder to maintain and understand, especially when 
   dealing with deeply nested components.

● Lifting State Up:
   Lifting state up is the process of moving the state management from
   a lower-level child component to a higher-level parent component. This is often 
   done to share state and behavior between sibling components or to 
   centralize the state management for better control and maintainability.

● Context Provider and Context Consumer:
   Context API in React provides a way to pass data through the component tree 
   without having to pass props down manually at every level. The Context Provider
   component allows you to define the data that you want to share, while the Context 
   Consumer component enables you to consume that data anywhere in the component tree
   without prop drilling.

● Default Value in Context Provider:
   Yes, if you don't pass a value to the provider, it takes the default value. 
   When creating a context using `React.createContext()`, you can 
   provide a default value. If no value is provided when consuming the context,
    React will use this default value. This is useful when you want to ensure that 
    there's always a value available for the context, even if it hasn't been explicitly 
    provided by a parent component.
