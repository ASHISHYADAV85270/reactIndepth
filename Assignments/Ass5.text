‚óè What is the importance of config.js file
    A config.js file is commonly used to store  configuration settings for an
     application. It centralizes configuration parameters such as API endpoints, 
    environment variables, database connections, etc. This separation of configuration
     from application code makes it easier to manage and modify settings without 
     touching the actual codebase. It also enhances security by keeping sensitive 
     information separate from the main code .
